# About This Project

This project is a simple template for starting writing a dApp using reactjs. [Tiny Dinos Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd9b78a2f1dafc8bb9c60961790d2beefebee56f4#code) is used as an example for methods call and send.
I used [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/index.html) for interaction with contracts and the chain.
It's always good to test the contract methods on etherscan before writing the code part.

## Features
- Interacting with wallet: Connect, Read Network, Change Network.
