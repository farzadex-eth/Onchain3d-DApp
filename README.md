# About This Project

OnChain3D is an innovative and challenging effort to create a 3D rendering algorithm in Solidity and put it fully on blockChain. The project aims to leverage the power of decentralized computing and blockchain technology to render 3D shapes and polygons using Solidity, which is known for its limitations in handling floating-point arithmetic.

The OnChain3D project was a result of the collaboration between two friends who shared a passion for blockchain technology and 3D rendering. [SciNFTist.eth](https://twitter.com/sciNFTist") developed the algorithm and [Farzadex.eth](https://twitter.com/farzadex) developed the best in class Dapp to enable users to interact with the project.

OnChain3D smart contract provides an interactive interface for users to modify the rendered image by changing the observer position, viewing mode, color, and opacity, etc. This feature allows users to explore and manipulate the 3D shape in real-time, providing a unique and engaging user experience.

## Contracts
Developed by [sciNFTist_eth](https://github.com/shypink): [OnChain3d Contracts Repo](https://github.com/shypink/OnChain3d)


## DApp
This branch is a fully functional DApp for the contract deployed on Goerli testnet. Tokens on Goerli testnet are minted on Zora.

## How to use

In the project directory, run:

`npm install`

Installs required packages for the project

`npm start`

Runs development server

* If you want to deploy your own contract based on ours, you have to change the contract addresses in Contracts.js file.

## Contribution
We would be really happy if you contribute to this project by any kind of work, like suggestions, ideas and coding.
