# About This Project

OnChain3D is an innovative and challenging effort to create a 3D rendering algorithm in Solidity and put it fully on blockChain. The project aims to leverage the power of decentralized computing and blockchain technology to render 3D shapes and polygons using Solidity, which is known for its limitations in handling floating-point arithmetic.

The OnChain3D project was a result of the collaboration between two friends who shared a passion for blockchain technology and 3D rendering. [SciNFTist.eth](https://twitter.com/sciNFTist") developed the algorithm and [Farzadex.eth](https://twitter.com/farzadex) developed the best in class Dapp to enable users to interact with the project.

## Contracts
Developed by [sciNFTist_eth](https://github.com/shypink): [OnChain3d Contracts Repo](https://github.com/shypink/OnChain3d)


## DApp
This repo contains 3 branches:
- **master**: This branch is for the contract on Ethereum mainnet and going to be fully functional like the other branches after deployment on mainnet. However, currently this branch include only links to our testnet DApps and contracts.
[OnChain3d Website](https://onchain3d.xyz)
- **goerli**: This branch is a fully functional DApp for the contract deployed on Goerli testnet. Tokens on Goerli testnet are minted on Zora.
[OnChain3d Goerli DApp](https://goerli.onchain3d.xyz)
- **sepolia**: This branch is a fully functional DApp for the contract deployed on Sepolia testnet. Tokens on Seploia testnet are minted on the DApp. 
[OnChain3d Sepolia DApp](https://sepolia.onchain3d.xyz)
- The reason behind the difference between Goerli and Sepolia contracts and DApps are because of Zora only supporting Goerli testnet. However, Goerli testnet is going to be deprecated soon and we decided to have the contract on Sepolia too.
